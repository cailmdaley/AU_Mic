There are many people to whom I am grateful, and I couldn't possibly list all of them here.
But I would like to begin by thanking Meredith Hughes, my advisor.
Your patience for my incessant questions and encouragement through periods of badness are unforgettable.
Your intelligence, sensibility, and kindness has added an inexpressible richness to the experience of doing research, one that I will surely miss.

To my family, including those who have recently joined as well as those who have recently left.
Both of my parents have provided so much support to me over the course of this year, each in their own way.
To my siblings, some of whom still can't believe that some people gravitate towards these subjects.

To all the members of the astronomy department, especially my dear friends and colleagues in the basement.
Your presence, not to mention all of your lightheartedness and intellectualism, has made this a lighter load to bear.

I've appreciated all the lessons, some explicit and some transferred through example,
