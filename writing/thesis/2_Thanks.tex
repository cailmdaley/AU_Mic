\chapter{Acknowledgements}

I would like to express my utmost gratitude to my advisor, Meredith Hughes.
I couldn't begin to recount all that I've learned from you.
Your intelligence, integrity, and kindness has added an inexpressible richness to the experience of doing research at Wesleyan.

To all the members of the astronomy department, especially my dear friends and colleagues in the basement.
Your presence has made this thesis a lighter load to bear, and has turned a scientific discipline into a community.
I would especially like to thank Roy Kilgard for helping me with endless technical difficulties and for always being there to talk.

To all the members of the disk detective research group, both past and present.
Working you has taught me a great deal about scientific collaboration, and most importantly, it's been a lot of fun.

Finally, I am so thankful for my family and their unwavering support.
To my parents, who have done so much to get me here.
To Patrice, Hop, and Kay, and to my siblings, some of whom still can't believe I think about these things for fun.
And to Kalina.
