\chapter{Observations}
AU Mic was observed  with ALMA on three dates: 26 March 2014, 18 August 2014, and 24 June 2015. 
All observations were configured with four spectral windows, and employed ALMA's 12m antennas and Band 7 receivers. 
Within each observation AU Mic was observed in seven-minute segments.\footnote{Extraneous?}
One spectral window was centered around the CO $J = (2-1)$ transition at a frequency of 230.538001 GHz, with a total bandwidth of 1.875 GHz and a channel spacing of 488 kHz.
The remaining three spectral windows were configured to detect continuum emission with central frequencies of 228.5, 213.5, and 216.0 GHz, total bandwidths of 2 GHz, and channel spacings of 15.6 MHz.

Information regarding the three observation dates can be found in Table \ref{tab:observations}. 
The short-baseline March observation provides information about AU Mic's disk on large spatial scales; in contrast, the subsequent long-baseline August observation was intended to trace the small-scale structure of the disk. 
The quality of the gain transfer for the August observation was tested using observations of the quasar J2057-3734.
Due to subpar\footnote{too informal?} quality, the August data were supplemented with a second night of long-baseline observations in June 2015. 
The quasar J2101-2933 was used to assess the gain transfer quality.
During the last segment of the June observation (04:23:38-04:29:58 UT), the host star flared. While we initially fit and subtracted off the flare fluxes (see Table \ref{tab:flare fluxes}), it was ultimately decided that the data taken during the flare was too problematic to be included in our analysis.

Calibration, reduction, and imaging were carried out using the \texttt{CASA} and
\texttt{MIRIAD} software packages. Standard ALMA reduction scripts were applied
to the datasets: phase calibration was accomplished via water vapor radiometry
tables, and system temperature calibrations were performed to account for
variations in instrument and weather conditions. Flux and bandpass calibrations
were subsequently applied.


The authors travelled to the NRAO facility in Charlottesville, VA in October
2015 to further process the data in \texttt{CASA}. 
% in particular the trip was intended to allow on-site correction of the 24 June flare. 
% tasks used to reduce the data at the NRAO facility were all part of the CASA package. 
For each observation, an elliptical gaussian was fit with the task \texttt{imfit} to a small region around the star in the sky plane (for the June date, the flare data were excluded).
The equatorial coordinates of the the model gaussian centroid were then used to define the star position, which was uncertain due to AU Mic's high proper motion: each dataset was phase shifted using the task \texttt{fixvis} so that the pointing center of the data was the same as the fitted star position.

Imaging was performed via standard Fourier inversion using the \texttt{CASA} task \texttt{tclean}. 
Two weighting schemes were used: (i) natural weighting with no taper, to trace the small-scale disk structure and (ii) natural weighting with a \SI{200}{k\lambda} Gaussian taper applied to long baselines, to bring out the disk emission on larger spatial scales. 
Because the \texttt{CASA} task \texttt{tclean} preserves pointing center offsets when converting several visibility datasets into an image, it was necessary to combine the data into a single file before cleaning in order to account for the offset in phase center between datasets. 
This was done using the task \texttt{concat}, which combines datasets with pointing centers aligned so long as their pointing centers do not differ by a value greater than the parameter \texttt{dirtol} (set to a value of \SI{2}{''}).

\begin{table}
  \centering

  \label{tab: imaging}
  \begin{tabular}{lrrr}
    \toprule
    Weighting Scheme & Beam Size (\si{''}) & Beam PA ($^\circ$) & RMS Noise (\si{\mu Jy}) \\
    \midrule
    Natural (no taper) & blank & blank & blank \\
    Natural (\SI{200}{k\lambda}) & blank & blank & blank \\
    \bottomrule
  \end{tabular}
\end{table}
% The peak flux of the model gaussian was also subtracted from the location of the star in the visibility domain so that only the disk remained.

% The 24 June dataset required additional reduction due to the flare. While for
% the other dates we were able to fit a single point source to account for the stellar
% component over the entire observation, the flare required that the dataset be
% split into one minute bins between 04:23:38 and 04:29:58 in order to account for
% the variable flux of the host star. For each of these bins, we used the task
% \texttt{uvmodelfit} to fit a point source to the long baseline visibilities,
% which we subsequently subtracted from each bin in the visibility domain.
% Subtracted point fluxes can be found in Table \ref{tab:flare fluxes}.

% The June date pointing center, defined by the centroid of the elliptical
% gaussian fit to the star, remained visibly offset from the disk; this
% could be explained if the flare referenced above were not symmetric with respect
% to the star. The offset was remedied by redefining the pointing center as
% follows. Because the star is known to be located at the center of the disk, we
% can use information provided by the brightness distribution of the disk to infer
% the star position. We do so by selecting the brightest pixel on each side of the
% disk from the clean component map (the \texttt{.model} file produced by
% \texttt{tclean}), and redefining the star/pointing center as the mean of the two
% pixel positions. This yields offsets of $(0.01'', -0.05'')$ for the March
% observation, $(0.01'', 0.00'')$ for the August observation, and $(0.00'',
% 0.09'')$ for the June observation. Given the good agreement between the
% calculated star position and the image center for the two non-flare dates (March
% and August), we conclude that the `pixel' method represents a viable way to
% accurately determine star position. We apply this correction and redefine the
% image center via \texttt{fixvis}. For consistency, we apply the phase shift to
% all three dates.

% Due to the high proper motion of AU Mic, the pointing centers of the three dates
% differ by a not-insignificant amount. When datasets with different pointing
% centers are cleaned together with \texttt{tclean}, the pointing center of the
% first dataset is taken as the new pointing center, and the data are combined in
% in the $uv$ plane with each subsequent dataset offset from the first as given by
% their relative pointing centers. In the case of AU Mic, this leads to an  image
% of the disk composed of three observations offset with respect to each other. To
% remedy this, we use the task \texttt{concat}, which combines datasets with their
% pointing centers aligned so long as the pointing centers do not differ by more
% than the value of \texttt{dirtol}. We set \texttt{dirtol} to $ 2''$, a value
% larger than  AU Mic's proper motion over ALMA's $\sim 1$ year observation
% baselines.

\chapter{Results}
AU Mic's disk is resolved in both the radial and vertical directions by the ALMA observations. The disk extends a distance of $\sim \SI{40}{au}$ on either side of the host star, although the NW side appears to reach slightly further radial extents than the SE side (\ref{fig: boccaletti}). However, we are not able to detect the PA offset described by \cite{boccaletti2015}

  Image-domain analysis of AU Mic's radial structure. 
  At each radial location, a Gaussian was fit to the surface brightness profile created by taking a slice along the vertical axis of the disk. 
  From top to bottom, the three plots represent the amplitude, centroid and width of the Gaussian fits. 
  In the bottom pane, the broadening effects of the restoring beam in the vertical direction have been removed; the fact that the image-domain vertical height of the disk is in excess of the beam contribution implies that our data spatially resolve the vertical structure of the disk disk.}
