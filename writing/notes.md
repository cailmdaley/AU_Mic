# AU Mic Fast-Moving Features Paper Notes


#### Boccaletti et al. (2014):
- 5 "arch- or wave-like" structures on SE side
  - radial separation from star between 10 and 55 au
  - radial extent between 5 and 10 au
  - vertical separation between 0.5 to 1.5
- as distance from star increases, features get fainter, broader and closer to midplane 
- measured (projected) speeds 4-6 km/s
  - all inconsistent with circular orbits; farthest out features exceed escape velocity


#### Sezestre et al. (2017):
- don't deal with height of vertical features
- "local process of dust release" --> parent body (ies?)
  - static parent body --> dust cloud due to giant collision 
  - dynamic parend body --> planet
- stellar wind interacts with dust & puts it on 'unbound trajectories'
- couldn't really distinguish between models but model conistently preferred Beta~6, where Beta is the ratio of radiative to gravitational forces.
- **We suggest that the arch-like structures are either formed from <= 0.1 Î¼m-sized grains if the stellar wind is very strong, or from nanometer-sized grains (. 20 nm) with a very narrow size distribution, in the case of a more moderate stellar activity**
